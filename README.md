# Who Spot Ya - a community for bird admireres

## Getting Started

During the planning phase I needed to figure out what data I needed to store for my models. I decided on 3 main models, USER, BIRD, and COMMENT. I also decided on building this app using referenced data instead of embeded, so all 3 models at some point reference each-other.

The next step of planning was figuring out the routing/controllers, I wanted to be able to access Birds and Users when interacting with the community page or user home page. Also leaving comments on the main community page was a big part of the app.

Ease of access was a big part of the views planning. I wanted to be sure each of the main route can be accessed from most pages.
